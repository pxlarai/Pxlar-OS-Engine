🌌 Pxlar Optimizer
The all-in-one system refinement engine for high-performance Windows environments.

Pxlar is a modular optimization suite designed to strip away Windows bloat, stabilize frame rates, and minimize network jitter. Built and tested on Windows 11 Insider Build 26200, this engine is designed to aggressively strip background tasks, successfully bringing process counts down into the 130s for a significantly leaner gaming experience.

⚠️ CRITICAL: READ BEFORE RUNNING
ACCOUNT SECURITY WARNING: This engine disables Windows Hello, PIN Login, and Biometrics to reduce background service latency.

YOU MUST KNOW YOUR MICROSOFT/WINDOWS ACCOUNT PASSWORD.

Your PIN will be removed. Upon reboot, Windows will require your full password to log in.

If you do not know your password, do not run this script until you have reset/verified it in Settings > Accounts.

🚀 The PXLAR Sequence
Pxlar executes optimizations in a specific order to ensure maximum effectiveness:

Step 0: Safety First – Automatically creates a System Restore Point and adjusts system frequency limits.

Step 1: Edge Vanisher – Completely removes Microsoft Edge, its updaters, and background telemetry.

Step 2: AI Hardware Analysis – Intelligently calculates and sets the optimal Static Paging File size based on your RAM.

Step 3: Power Tuning – Forces high-performance power delivery and optimizes CPU core parking.

Step 4: Ping & Network – Fine-tunes the TCP stack, disables Nagle's Algorithm, and flushes DNS.

Step 5: Interactive Debloater – Advanced manual control over Windows Defender, Xbox services, and telemetry.
